<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is claire and I am a Graphic Design student at and I want to major in Web Development. I have always had the passion for helping to make ideas come to life. I have many other passions and side hobbies, such as: <i> Astronomy, Science, Physics, Chemistry, Coding, Drawing, and Design.</i></p>

<p>I am 20 years old and I live in Ontario, Canada. I'd like to mention this is not a portfolio website but more a test site to practice my web development skills. I will be creating more sites, perhaps about things that interest me. If youd like to contact me, follow the link provided.
